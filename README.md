#Mini Project 3

Mini project 3 is about building a Wiki about something I like. The requirements are: 

* a static_controller with actions and corresponding views for an

> an about page (accessed as /about)

> an faq page (accessed as /faq)

* a controller that represents the thing you like, e.g. cakes_controller. It should include

> an index page (also accessible as root ie. /) that lists atleast 5 different items e.g. cakes

> At least 5 different show pages with different content displayed a specific item based upon the id provided in the url e.g. /cakes/5/ . This should reuse a single show.html.erb file


Do not use Scaffold and do not create any models. This is an activity to focus on controllers, routes and views.

ach controller should use a different layout.
